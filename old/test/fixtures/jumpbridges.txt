Jump Bridges[edit]

A Jump Bridge is module that links two systems up to 5 light years apart. Players can use them to navigate between star systems and jump much like a capital ship.
Only members of the alliance the JB belongs to can fuel it or see how much fuel it has, so as of now if a bridge is unfueled you're SOL. Ask the alliance living in the region for help. In our space in Deklein, it is a good idea to carry some extra ozone just in case a bridge is empty.
WARNING: Use of a jump bridge now incurs jump fatigue. Once used, a jump bridge cannot be used again until your jump cooldown wears off. If you need to cover a large distance with jump bridges, consider using a T1 or T2 Industrial or other bonused hull, or avoiding the bridges altogether in favor of using an Interceptor to travel.
Known Jump Bridges[edit]

Grouped by region (see maps below). Format for tower locations is System @ Planet-Moon.
Jump Bridge access is based on standings.
If you are adding new jump bridges to this list, and want to use a new color, make sure to pick a valid [HTML Color Name] to use, or it won't show up. If you don't know the jump bridge ly distance, use the dotlan jump route planer to find out.

Using a Jump Bridge[edit]

Note: (especially newbies:) Jump bridges now appear in corporate bookmarks. Right-clicking in space should show you a bookmark for the jump bridge in that system.
Fly to POS Jumpbridge in space
Newbies: The first time, you need to right-click in space, choose the Planets submenu, then the appropriate planet from the list, then the Moons submenu and finally "Warp to within 100 KM" on the correct moon. This will allow you to then target and warp to the jump bridge instead of slow boating over to it.
Once there, right-click the bridge and bookmark it, since it will likely be a fair way from the warpin point and a bookmark will allow you to warp directly within range of the bridge from elsewhere within the system
Approach the bridge within 2500m
If using our own JBs if/when we have any, right click on the module, access resources, and use shift+drag to add in the ozone you need to jump (see calculator below)
Right click the module and choose "Jump through to xxxxx"
Once you are through, bookmark the jumpbridge on that side as well.

Your Ship's Mass and You[edit]
Your ship mass affects the amount of ozone needed for your ship to jump. There are two things that can increase your ship's mass. Be aware of them when traveling through jumpbridges.
Any online armor plates (1600mm reinforced rolled tungsten, for example) will increase your ship's mass. Offline them if possible.
Having your MWD active will increase your ship's mass. Make sure it's not running.
(Nanofibers/Polycarbs don't affect mass as of Quantum Rise)
Things to note[edit]
Don't go AFK or park empty ships in a jumpbridge POS. Every faggot and spy in the alliance knows the jumpbridge POS passwords, and your ship will probably be bumped out or stolen by some random hostile.
When you spawn at your destination, you do NOT have the cloak you get jumping through a stargate. Be wary of landing on the far side of a JB where a hostile engagement might be.
You do however still get a 30-sec invulnerability when jumping through a bridge - you are visible but unlockable for 30 seconds or until you move, whichever comes first. If you did just jump into hostiles make the most of that time to look for a way out.
No racial isotopes are required to use an array, only liquid ozone within the jump bridge.
The liquid ozone is required in the array you are jumping FROM, and not your destination.
Jump bridges have to be 45km from the tower, which means you jump in around 15km outside the shields. All these pos's have guns but if you don't trust that cover, then don't use them.
Freighters CAN load ozone into the array provided they are within 49.9km of the tower. Note that it is possible to be stuck if the freighter is on the far side of the bridge from the tower - in that situation they will need to slowly move around the jumpbridge. Edit: For fucks sake, bookmark the bridge, warp to a celestial and warp back. *WTF don't do this with a freighter you mongoloids. A GSOL-operated rorqual is your friend, but if you just happen to run across one that's dry, use a t1 hauler or something.
Jump Bridge Fuel Calculators[edit]

Evemap-import.png

GARPA Topographical Survey (formerly known as EVE-Map) has a built-in ozone calculator and can also import this wiki page, populating all goonfleet bridges within the program. Once you have imported jumpbridge data it will automatically factor them into its route finding.
http://apps.goonfleet.com/evetools/route.html - Firefox-only route calculator. Automatically pulls in goonfleet jump bridges from this page, no import needed.
To calculate the ozone required yourself, multiply your ship's mass (in millions, so a merlin is 1.45) by half the distance the bridge crosses in lightyears, listed in the tables above.
