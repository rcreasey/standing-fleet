## Note for developers:
Make sure that you simulate the EVE IGB headers for your browser.  Chrome has an excellent plugin for this: [ModHeader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/modheader/idgpnmonknjnojddfkpgkljpfnnfcklj?hl=en).

Your best bet is to set all vaild [IGB headers](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/IGB_Headers), including your actual pilot name and characterID.
