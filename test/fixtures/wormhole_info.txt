An unstable wormhole, deep in space.  Wormholes of this kind usually collapse after a few days, and lead to anywhere.

This wormhole seems to lead into unknown parts of space.

This wormhole is beginning to decay, and probably won't last another day.
This wormhole has had its stability reduced by ships passing through it, but not to a critical degree yet.
Larger ships can pass through this wormhole.
